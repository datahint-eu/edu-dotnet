Everything you should know (in my opinion) as a .NET developer. The list starts with junior level stuff and will build up to advanced senior developer knowledge. However the guide assumes you have basic programming skills and you are familiar with the C# *syntax*.

This guide doesn't rehash the information you find in the [Learn C# documentation](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp) from Microsoft.
Instead, it focusses on a list of topics with links to more in depth information. Additionally, the guide focusses on specific C# language knowledge, .NET framework classes, design patterns and algorithms that help you build excellent applications.

The 'how' has been explained a million times, I simply try to explain the 'why' sprinkled with some knowledge gained over a period of 20 years.

## Getting Started

- [Summary of the basics](csharp/Basics_summary.md): **you need to know all these topics before reading the rest of the guide.**

## The .NET platform

TODO
- IDisposable
- Encoding namespace

- Convert class
- IEquatable, IComparable
- Collections
